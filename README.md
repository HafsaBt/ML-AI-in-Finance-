#ML&AI in Finance : FRAUD DETECTION 

Rapid advances in technology and digitization have led to an increase in the use of online
financial transactions. These advancements have certainly improved the speed and convenience
of transactions, but they also pose the problem of fraudulent activity. Fraud detection in
financial transactions is a major challenge for financial institutions, and traditional rule-based
systems often struggle to keep up with sophisticated fraud techniques.
In this report, we investigate the effectiveness of various classification algorithms in identifying
fraudulent transactions.The main objective is to find an accurate fraud detection model that can
help reduce losses caused by fraudulent activities.
We conducted a comprehensive comparative study using several popular machine-learning
classification algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and
Support Vector Machines (SVM). These algorithms are chosen based on their ability to handle
complex data patterns and their wide usability in various machine-learning applications. Our
study focused on evaluating the performance of these models on a the data set provided,
comparing their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.
